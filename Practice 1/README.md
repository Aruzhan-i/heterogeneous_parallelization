## Overview

This directory contains **Practice 1** materials for the course **Heterogeneous Parallelization**, prepared according to the professor’s GitHub requirements.

Each practice folder contains:

* Program block schemes
* C++ source code with comments
* Answers to control questions
* Screenshots of console output

## Practice Topic and Goal

**Laboratory work №1**
**Topic:** Introduction to C/C++ fundamentals and data structures

**Goal:**

* Learn arrays, pointers, and dynamic memory
* Implement basic data structures
* Get introduced to OpenMP parallel programming
* Compare sequential and parallel execution

---

## Theoretical Background

The practice covers:

* Pointers and dynamic memory management
* Arrays and dynamic data structures
* Stack, queue, and singly linked list
* Basics of OpenMP (`parallel for`, `reduction`)

---

## Practice Tasks

### Part 1 — Arrays and OpenMP

* Array creation and initialization
* Minimum and maximum search
* Sequential vs parallel execution

### Part 2 — Data Structures

* Singly linked list
* Stack (LIFO)
* Queue (FIFO)

### Part 3 — Dynamic Memory and Pointers

* Dynamic array allocation
* Average value computation
* Parallel reduction using OpenMP

---

## Block Schemes (Flowcharts)

### Task 1 — Arrays: Min/Max

### Task 3 — Dynamic Memory and Average Value

## Source Code

| Task   | File         |
| ------ | ------------ |
| Task 1 | `task_1.cpp` |
| Task 2 | `task_2.cpp` |
| Task 3 | `task_3.cpp` |

All programs are written in **C++**, include **detailed comments**, and use **OpenMP** where required.

## Control Questions and Answers

The practice includes answers to the following control questions:

1. Differences between arrays and dynamic data structures
2. What is a pointer and how it is used in C++
3. Stack and queue principles
4. Advantages and disadvantages of singly linked lists
5. Proper memory deallocation in C++
6. Importance of pointers for parallel programming
7. OpenMP `reduction` usage
8. Effect of parallel programming on performance

(Answers are provided in written form as part of the practice.)
